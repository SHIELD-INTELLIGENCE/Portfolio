      <h2>About SHIELD</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>SHIELD (Students Hub for Intelligence, Elegance, Learning and Defence)</strong> is a global initiative forged to confront evolving threats through foresight, action, and integrity. We are more than an organization—we are a commitment to the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Founded and directed by <strong>Reyansh Raj Mishra</strong> and <strong>Akshit Pandey</strong>, SHIELD bridges elite intelligence, private security, humanitarian strategy, and tactical innovation to secure tomorrow’s world—today.
      </p> 
      <p>
        From cyber defense to strategic reconnaissance, SHIELD operates with precision, discipline, and discretion. Our agents don’t wear capes—they operate silently, effectively, and ethically across continents.

        From cyber defense to strategic reconnaissance, SHIELD operates with precision, discipline, and discretion. Our agents don’t wear capes—they operate silently, effectively, and ethically across continents.
      </p>
      <p>        We are the unseen guardians, the silent sentinels, and the strategic minds who ensure that threats are neutralized before they escalate. Our mission is to protect peace, not power.
        We believe peace is earned—not promised. Our mission is to identify vulnerabilities before they become crises and act where others hesitate.
      </p>
      <p>
        SHIELD is built on the principle that information, discipline, and sacrifice can outmaneuver any threat. We are the line between chaos and order. This is our legacy.
